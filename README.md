# The Last of Us (SA-MP) Project
So here it is, since the beginning of 2014 december, after many failed attempts and re-writing entire project from scratch twice (this is the third one) here's another failed attempt of mine of launching this gamemode.

As much as I'm in love with the original The Last of Us game and I was addicted with San Andreas Multi Player (SA-MP) since it's very early 0.1b version launch back in 2005 I cannot work on that project anymore and I guess it's my time to depart from the community.

# Third attempt 
This project's (3rd attempt) rewriting process has started at 2019-01-10, **I didn't use any SVN back then yet** so that may be why some of the commits have started somewhere mid 2019 and not from the beginning.

The reason why another attempt has occured is because I couldn't read my own code after coming back to it, so I've decided to switch onto modular programming style and now not to say - it is definetely way easier to understand the logic of such a complex gamemode and debug instead of one huge *.pwn file.

# Future
Even though I'm trying not to be very connected with the code I have written for this project - *I can't* - simply because if I wouldn't then I would have no-one to thank for my current Software Developer ASP.NET Job. Crazy how simple procedural PAWN language can lead you to higher standards.

I am not interested in participating of the development of that gamemode anymore. If you message me I might answer some questions but other than that I wouldn't want to write any more code for it.

# Prerequisites
