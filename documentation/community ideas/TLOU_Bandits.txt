Bandit faction is the evil faction in the TLOU.

As we were able to witness in SP, they live in deserted QZ's which were abandoned by the Army. They have no policy of killing unarmed Civilians. I think thats what is so dangerous about them - they can either rob people or kill them for their loot.

Bandits are needed to be here to cause not only NPC infected fear, but aswell as player fear aswell - the unpredictability of it is vital and important in the TLOU as it was on Single Player - they roam arround not only in cities but small counties, villages too. I think their spawn location should be outside the city but not as far outside - somehwere where they have full control of a teritory and know the surroundings.

Application?


I believe one does not simply apply to become bandit cause that woudn't make sense of it. I believe in order to be a bandit, you need to act like one. What I'm talking about is stealing, killing. If you steal x ammount of supplies, or kill x ammount of people I believe you can automaticly be named bandit, but you are to be alone untill you are invited into official bandit faction.
