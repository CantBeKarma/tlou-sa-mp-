Fireflies.


The most controversial faction I believe. This is both Militaristic/Survivalist faction. It has unique combination of that. 

To explain Fireflies in SP is hard cause we know few, however they are migrant faction - they don't overstay at one city, yet we also know that they have few numbers aswell. I believe fireflies are scavenging faction - they find items thoughout the apocalyptic world, sell them to the civilians and gain profit thus surviving with the entire faction. They own arsenall of weapons themselves, but I think its only cause they tend to steal suppplies from city. 


I think Fireflies are the ones who control black market - set the prizes of each, buys and sells things, gets the things that player wants for the right ammount of ration cards. I believe their spawn should be outside of safezone, somewhere where they also consider themselves to be safe. Now we know in the game that Marlene's goal was to search for a cure to stop the disease - a goal that failed. /WE/ do not know if in TLOU Part II this will be continued, so I will not include finding the cure objective cause of uncertain things and cause it woudn't be much of a interesting cause then it would ruin the point of Fungus infected NPC's.
