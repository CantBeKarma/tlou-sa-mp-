# Custom animations

I am providing some custom animations for the gamemode created in 3Ds Max and merged into one single file called "TLoU.ifp" which can be found in the assets folder.

# Side note as of 2020-02-09

Remaining animation files:

- buddy.ifp
- colt45.ifp
- rifle.ifp
- shotgun.ifp

are simple animations replacement of the weapons shooting (they are supposed to be placed in the custom.IMG file)

- ladder_clmbdwn.ifp
- ladder_clmbup.ifp

Those two I don't remember :) Required to look-up in 3Ds Max for their animation names and library but definetely I wanted to make some kind of ladder climbing system with custom animations.
