# Custom animations

I am providing some custom animations for the gamemode created in 3Ds Max and merged into one single file called "TLoU.ifp" which can be found in the assets folder.

| Anim name     | Information                                                                                          |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| WEAPON_SWITCH | That's actually an animation from GTA IV of switching weapons (I didn't use it but it's still there) |
| BOW_AIM_IN    | Starts aiming bow                                                                                    |
| BOW_AIM_IDLE  | Aiming bow                                                                                           |
| INF_BITE      | Infected animation of biting an entity                                                               |
| INF_EAT_IN    | Infected animation of eating corpses                                                                 |
| INF_WALK      | Walking animation for the infected                                                                   |
| INF_RUN       | Running animation for the infected                                                                   |

# Side note as of 2020-02-09
Animation's library is "TLoU" so if you want to apply animation on the character in game you have to provide animation's library and animation's name.
