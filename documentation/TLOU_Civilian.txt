I think everyone who registers becomes Civilian at once. Its like a newbie level till you get use to the TLOU SAMP system and want to become someone else. 


So I believe Civilians are bare people who try to connect back with back, and are in constant small resource field. 

They shoudn't spawn with any gun of some sort, they have to work(jobs maybe?) or scavenge for supplies, and sell them in black market to earn something(ration cards not money) and eventually work up to own a weapon or a base.


I mention jobs, I will make different list of jobs that could be done in apocalyptic world of TLOU. But the main concern is the Civilians. They start bare, they have to do something to get what they want. I believe Civilians should be the main core that could buy things off black market from factions like fireflies or bandits. It would be their only way to get illegal items and posses them under their own. 


Skill setup

Same as U.S Army - they have absolutely zero skill of shooting. Aswell as any other skill level is absolutely zero.  


Civilian Objectives

- Survive(I believe thats very obvious)
- Join a Faction(either if its Army, Firefilies or Bandits)
- Build a base of your own and create your own safefort or hell on earth.
